# The DevOps & Platform Engineer Mindset

To transition from **Support** to **Platform Engineering**, use this guide to evaluate every file and resource in this project.

## 1. The Three Questions (Every File)
1. **The Contract:** What does this need (inputs/env) and what does it provide (outputs/ports)?
2. **The Failure Mode:** If this fails, what does the error look like in the logs? How does it self-heal?
3. **The Portability:** How much of this is "Standard" vs "Cloud Provider Specific"?

## 2. Takeaways by File Type

### 📂 Source Code (`.js`, `.py`, etc.)
- **Integration Points:** How does it talk to DBs or APIs?
- **Config Injection:** Look for `process.env`. Never hardcode secrets.
- **Health Checks:** Is there a `/healthz` (liveness) and `/readyz` (readiness) endpoint?

### 🐳 Dockerfiles
- **Security:** Does it run as a non-root user?
- **Efficiency:** Is it a multi-stage build? Is the final image small?
- **Immutability:** Does the image contain everything it needs to run without external downloads?

### 🏗️ Terraform (`.tf`)
- **Least Privilege:** Does the IAM role have only the bare minimum permissions?
- **State:** How is the "truth" of the infrastructure stored?
- **Reusability:** How do we use the same code for Dev, UAT, and Prod?

### ☸️ Kubernetes & Helm (`.yaml`)
- **Resource Limits:** Are CPU and Memory limits defined to prevent cluster crashes?
- **Networking:** How does traffic flow from the User -> Gateway -> Service -> Pod?
- **Scaling:** What triggers a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)?

## 3. Core Concepts
- **Statelessness:** If I delete a Pod, no data should be lost (data lives in the DB).
- **Observability:** Can I diagnose a problem using only Logs and Metrics?
- **Idempotency:** If I run this command twice, does it stay in the correct state without breaking?
- **GitOps:** Git is the single source of truth. If it's not in Git, it's a "ghost" resource.

## The 3 Questions — ask them about every file

1. **Contract** — what inputs does it need, what does it expose?
2. **Failure mode** — when it breaks, what's the log line, and how does it self-heal?
3. **Portability** — what's standard vs. cloud-locked? Could I move it in a week?

## Per-file checklist

### 📂 Source code
- [ ] Config from env vars, never hardcoded
- [ ] Secrets injected at runtime, never in image
- [ ] `/health` (liveness) + `/ready` (readiness) exist and mean different things
- [ ] Stateless — kill the pod, lose nothing

### 🐳 Dockerfile
- [ ] Multi-stage build, final image < 200 MB
- [ ] Runs as non-root (`USER 1000`)
- [ ] Pinned base image digest, no `:latest`
- [ ] No `apt-get` at runtime — image is fully self-contained

### 🏗️ Terraform
- [ ] IAM is least privilege — every role defended in review
- [ ] State is remote, encrypted (CMEK), versioned
- [ ] Same module runs dev/uat/prod — only `tfvars` differ
- [ ] `prevent_destroy` on anything that holds data

### ☸️ Kubernetes / Helm
- [ ] CPU + memory `requests` and `limits` set
- [ ] HPA + PDB + topology spread defined
- [ ] NetworkPolicy default-deny in the namespace
- [ ] `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`, `runAsNonRoot: true`, drop ALL caps

## 4 core principles (memorize)

| Principle | One-line test |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Statelessness** | Can I `kubectl delete pod` without losing data? |
| **Observability** | Can I diagnose using only logs + metrics + traces? |
| **Idempotency** | Does running it twice end in the same state? |
| **GitOps** | If it's not in git, it doesn't exist. |

## Self-test (no peeking — answer aloud)

### Beginner — you should know these in week 1
1. What's the difference between liveness and readiness probes? Give a scenario where one passes and the other fails.
2. Why does a container run as a non-root user? What happens if it doesn't?
3. What does `terraform plan` do that `terraform apply` doesn't?
4. Why is `:latest` an anti-pattern in Kubernetes manifests?
5. A pod is `CrashLoopBackOff`. Name three commands you'd run, in order.

### Intermediate — you should know these in month 1
6. What is Workload Identity and why is it better than mounting a service account JSON key?
7. Explain the GitOps reconciliation loop. What happens if I `kubectl edit` a resource ArgoCD manages?
8. Why do we put a `PodDisruptionBudget` on a service that has an HPA?
9. What's the blast radius of a leaked CI service account key in our setup? What limits it?
10. CMEK vs Google-managed encryption — when does the difference actually matter?

### Advanced — you should be able to defend these in design review
11. Walk through how a request from the internet reaches `account-service`. Name every hop and what enforces security at each one.
12. Cloud SQL primary fails at 03:00. What happens, in what order, and what's the customer-visible impact?
13. Someone pushes an image with a HIGH CVE. Name every gate that should stop it before it runs in dev.
14. How would you onboard a new microservice in under a day? List the artifacts that must exist before traffic flows.
15. Our SLO is 99.9% availability. We've burned 80% of the monthly error budget on day 10. What do you do?

### Trap questions — these expose weak mental models
16. Why is `kubectl apply` not idempotent in all cases? (Hint: think about field ownership.)
17. If both Terraform and ArgoCD manage Kubernetes resources, who owns what — and how do you decide?
18. We enabled Binary Authorization in `DRYRUN` mode. What does that actually prevent? What does it not?
19. A Slack alert fires for high p99 latency, but Grafana shows latency is fine. Name three reasons this can happen.
20. We have backups. Are we sure we can restore? How do we know?

## Daily ritual

**Morning (5 min):** read this file. Pick one checklist item.
**During work:** apply it to one PR or file you touch.
**End of day (2 min):** answer one question above. If you stumbled, mark it and revisit tomorrow.

After 30 days, you don't read this — you live it.
